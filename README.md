This is a barebone project for STMF407 Discovery Kit. It can be built using pure GNU-ARM toolchains and make tools. Oh man how clean it is to get rid of all the ugly IDEs and controll directly how your code is built! I am a controll freak. Do not judge me. 

I'll add in more examples whiel I experiment with the MCU. The build environment will also been constantly improved over time. 

Keep tuned for updates.
